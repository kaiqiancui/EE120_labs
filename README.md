# UCB EE120: Signal and Systems
- I studied the course Signals and Systems in school, using Oppenheim's textbook, but I am confused about this course. 
- In this repository, I uploaded the lab I completed for EE120 and some of my notes.
- The resources of EE120 have been blocked in recent times.
- I use the resources of https://github.com/dominiccarrano/ee-120-labs?tab=readme-ov-file and flyingpig

# ee-120-labs
Python virtual labs implemented via the Jupyter Notebook developed for <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/EE120/">*EE 120: Signals and Systems*</a> at UC Berkeley. 

## About

These labs were developed by the EE 120 course staff in the spring 2019, fall 2019, and spring 2020 semesters. The topics follow our course's content and are listed below. They're ideal for an entry-level upper division course with a focus in signal processing where the students have some prior programming exposure.

We presented these labs at the *2020 International Conference on Higher Education Advances*. The paper is available [here](http://headconf.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/11308.pdf).

## Usage

The relevant Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file that students complete for Lab N is at `labN/labN.ipynb`. For example, the file for Lab 3 is named `lab3.ipynb`, located in the `lab3` folder. The folder `labN` also contains all resources necessary for that lab to function as intended. Changing the directory structure provided in this repository may cause issues, since the labs expect certain fixed filepaths (e.g., when displaying images inside the notebook, loading data from provided files, or running test cases to provide students with sanity checks on their work).

The versions here are without solutions. If you're an educator at another institution and would like to use these in your course, contact Prof. Babak Ayazifar (ayazifar@berkeley.edu) about acquiring solutions.
